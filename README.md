# Fire in the Hole

A puzzle game where you’re stuck in a room with a ticking time bomb. Picking up the bomb pauses the timer momentarily, but it’s inevitably going to blow. Prevent the bomb from destroying your exit route (and yourself), or use the bomb to clear obstacles in order to reach the exit.

The game features ten levels demonstrating various puzzle elements, and each level can be completed in under a minute. The estimated play time for the full game is approximately five minutes.

This is our first entry into Ludum Dare, and our first attempt at a puzzle game. While we ran into some trouble along the way and the game is quite rough around the edges, I’m proud of what we accomplished and I quite enjoy the concept we came up with.
